We believe that social media provides a powerful, largely-untapped source of data on public sentiment towards vaccines. Harnessing this information holds promise for public health research, but the field requires further contributions to generate informative conclusions. Our open-source project aims to expand the frontiers of this field and provide preliminary guidance to others working on similar problems.

To facilitate public engagement and understanding, we have both an [accessible overview](https://qtoussaint.github.io/posts/overview/) of our project that describes the data used, the basic structure of the pipeline, and how to interpret the results (including what they can and cannot tell us), as well as an [in-depth description](https://qtoussaint.github.io/posts/methods/) geared towards researchers and other professionals in the field, which aim to make the project as transparent and accessible as possible. Read our guides below!

Feedback and questions are highly encouraged; you can find our contact details under "About the Creators" in the top right.
